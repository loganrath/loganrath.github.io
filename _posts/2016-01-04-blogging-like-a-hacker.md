title: Blogging like a hacker?

Every winter break I take on a personal coding project. 

This year I've decided to redesign my personal site.
I've recently gotten involved with [GitHub](http://www.github.com) as a place to host code. It wasn't long before I found [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and was inspired by the post [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) by Tom Preston-Werner, a co-founder of GitHub. After that, I was sold on the newest challenge: get a GitHub hosted blog and site going ASAP.

I enjoy using GitHub pages (so far) because it allows me to work with code (blog posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example)), so I'm writing this blog post using a basic text editor. The GitHub desktop application lets me upload the code and then sync my changes to build the page in just a few clicks.

So, here we go. I'll now be blogging like a hacker.
