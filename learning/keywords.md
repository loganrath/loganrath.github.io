title: "Search Terms and Keywords"
---
This page brings together content that I have used to teach about keywords. The [standard disclaimer](/disclaimer.html) applies.

Videos
---
1. [Finding and Selecting Keywords, University of West Florida](https://video.lib.uwf.edu/video_player/play.php?ok&width=1440&height=699&security=unrestricted&res=720&course=research_tutorials&video=selecting_and_using_keywords)
: This video is made by [Joshua Vossler](http://joshuavossler.com/), and is of high quality. There is specific information at the end for UWF. I generally stop playing the video before the institution-specific information plays.


Websites
---
1. [Auburn University Selecting Keywords to Search](https://www.lib.auburn.edu/aubieasks/tutorials/keywords/#/)
: This self-paced module was also awarded a Primo award for library instruction. I prefer it to the Keyword Generator below.

2. [IUPUI Keyword Generator](https://apps.lib.utexas.edu/apps/libraries/key/nlogon/)
: This site was originally developed at UTAustin where it was awarded a Primo award for library instruction. I find it incredibly useful.


Handouts
---
1. [ProCon list](files/ProCon.docx) - A handout with various Pro/Con keywords that might be useful to focus a search.

2. [Concept Map](files/ConceptMap.pdf) - A concept mapping tool to help expand searching

3. [Keywords 2 Up](files/Vossler_Keywords_2up.pdf) - A handout that mimics the Video #1 listed above.


Activities
---
1. Have students work in groups together to come up with as many different keywords for a given topic.
