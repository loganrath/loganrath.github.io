I am currently an assistant instructor with [RU4Scuba](https://www.ru4scubaa.com), based out of Williamson, NY. We provide training in the Rochester area. I can teach [Try Scuba](https://ru4scubaa.com/courses/try-scuba-diving), [Scuba Skills Update](https://ru4scubaa.com/courses/scuba-skills-update), [Perfect Buoyancy](https://ru4scubaa.com/courses/perfect-buoyancy), and [SSI Explorers](https://ru4scubaa.com/courses/blue-oceans-snorkel-explorer). Our shop schedules classes at times that are convenient for you.
