This page brings together content that I have used to teach about keywords. The [standard disclaimer](/disclaimer.html) applies.

Videos

1. [Finding and Selecting Keywords, University of West Florida](https://video.lib.uwf.edu/video_player/play.php?ok&width=1440&height=699&security=unrestricted&res=720&course=research_tutorials&video=selecting_and_using_keywords)
: This video is made by [Joshua Vossler](http://joshuavossler.com/), and is of high quality. There is specific information at the end for UWF. I generally stop playing the video before the institution-specific information plays.


Websites
---
1. [IUPUI Keyword Generator](http://ulib.iupui.edu/keywords/)
: This site was originally developed at UTAustin where it was awarded a Primo award for library instruction. I find it incredibly useful.

Activities

1. Have students work in groups together to come up with as many different keywords for a given topic.
