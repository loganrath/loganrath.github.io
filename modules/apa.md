This page brings together content that I have used to teach about [APA Citation](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html).

Videos
---
[APA Citation Style, University of West Florida's <i>Using Sources Ethically</i>](https://uwf.edu/library/research_help/using-sources-ethically/)
 * This video is made by [Joshua Vossler](http://joshuavossler.com/), and are of high quality. There is specific information at the end for UWF. I generally stop playing the video before the institution-specific information plays.

[APA In Text Citations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Efaqn6gGE)
 * I made this video to address common errors that students new to APA make when writing. 

PowerPoints
---
[OWL at Purdue's APA Slideshow](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_powerpoint_slide_presentation.html)
 * This powerpoint is a nice concise way to show the basic formatting of APA.

Websites
---
[Citation Fox](https://library.albany.edu/cfox)
 * This website was developed by the librarians at the [University at Albany](https://library.albany.edu/). I know them personally and trust their work.

[OWL at Excelsior](https://owl.excelsior.edu/citation-and-documentation/apa-style/)
 * These pages are often more student friendly than the OWL at Purdue. I like the way they are laid out.

Templates
---
[Microsoft's APA 6th Edition Template](https://templates.office.com/en-us/APA-style-report-6th-edition-TM03982351)
 * Note: This template typically has more than is needed for most papers.

[Modified APA Template for Brockport](apa_template.docx)
 * This is a template I modified from the Microsoft Template.
