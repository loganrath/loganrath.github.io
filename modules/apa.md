title: "Sources for Teaching American Psychological Association Format"

This page brings together content that I have used to teach about [APA Citation](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html). The [standard disclaimer](/disclaimer.html) applies.

Videos
---
1. [APA Citation Style, University of West Florida's <i>Using Sources Ethically</i>](https://uwf.edu/library/research_help/using-sources-ethically/)
: This video is made by [Joshua Vossler](http://joshuavossler.com/), and are of high quality. There is specific information at the end for UWF. I generally stop playing the video before the institution-specific information plays.

2. [APA In Text Citations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Efaqn6gGE)
: I made this video to address common errors that students new to APA make when writing. 

PowerPoints
---
1. [OWL at Purdue's APA Slideshow](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_powerpoint_slide_presentation.html)
: This powerpoint is a nice concise way to show the basic formatting of APA.

Websites
---
1. [Citation Fox](https://library.albany.edu/cfox)
: This website was developed by the librarians at the [University at Albany](https://library.albany.edu/). I know them personally and trust their work.

2. [OWL at Excelsior](https://owl.excelsior.edu/citation-and-documentation/apa-style/)
: These pages are often more student friendly than the OWL at Purdue. I like the way they are laid out.

Templates
---
1. [Microsoft's APA 6th Edition Template](https://templates.office.com/en-us/APA-style-report-6th-edition-TM03982351)
: Note: This template typically has more than is needed for most papers.

2. [Modified APA Template for Brockport](http://library.brockport.edu/ld.php?content_id=28580900)
: This is a template I modified from the default Microsoft template linked above.

Activities
---
1. Have students search for their sources and use copy/paste to create a starter references list. Then, have students fix their references list in proper APA format.

2. As a class, walk students through how to cite the specific sources they need for their assignment. This works particularly well if the whole class needs to cite the same source (e.g. the textbook).
