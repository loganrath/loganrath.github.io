This page brings together content that I have used to teach about [APA Citation](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html). 

Resources

I have found the following resources to be of great use when facilitating learning about APA:

[APA Citation Style, University of West Florida's /Using Sources Ethically/](https://uwf.edu/library/research_help/using-sources-ethically/)
   This video is made by [Joshua Vossler](http://joshuavossler.com/), and are of high quality. There is specific information at the end for UWF. I generally stop playing the video before the institution-specific information plays.

[OWL at Purdue's APA Slideshow](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_powerpoint_slide_presentation.html)
   This powerpoint is a nice concise way to show the basic formatting of APA.

[APA In Text Citations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Efaqn6gGE)
   I made this video to address common errors that students new to APA make when writing.
