<h2>UNESCO Summary from Notebook LM</h2>
<p>NotebookLM</p>
<p>K-12 AI curricula emphasize a range of thematic areas and learning outcomes designed to prepare students for life and work in the AI era. The goal is for citizens to understand the impact of AI, its capabilities and limitations, when it is useful, and how it can be steered for the public good, while also ensuring foundational skills like literacy and numeracy are not lost.</p>
<p>The curricula are broadly structured around three main categories of content, which collectively account for the majority of teaching time:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>AI Foundations</strong> (average 41% of curriculum time)</li>
	<li><strong>Ethics and Social Impact</strong> (average 24% of curriculum time)</li>
	<li><strong>Understanding, Using, and Developing AI</strong> (average 25% of curriculum time) An additional 10% may be unspecified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of the key thematic areas and their associated learning outcomes:</p>

<h3><strong>Key Thematic Areas</strong></h3>

<p>The nine core topic areas within K-12 AI curricula are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>AI Foundations</strong>:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Algorithms and Programming</strong>: This forms a basis for technical engagement with AI. It is the largest share within AI foundations.</li>
		<li><strong>Data Literacy</strong>: Focuses on managing the data cycle (collection, cleaning, labelling, analysis, reporting) and understanding its role in AI&#39;s ethical and logistical challenges.</li>
		<li><strong>Contextual Problem-Solving</strong>: Frames AI as a solution to business or social challenges, integrating concepts like design thinking and project-based learning. Curricula engaging this area often invest heavily in it as part of a project-based learning cycle.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Ethics and Social Impact</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Ethics of AI</strong>: Covers ethical terms (bias, fairness, representation), the meaning of &#39;ethical AI&#39;, and avenues for redress in cases of unethical use. This area tends to draw a high percentage commitment from curricula with the smallest hour commitments.</li>
		<li><strong>Social/Societal Implications of AI</strong>: Addresses broader impacts like workforce transformation, changes to legal frameworks, and new governance mechanisms. Only 12 out of 21 curricula included social implications.</li>
		<li><strong>Applications of AI to other Domains</strong>: Explores AI applications beyond computer science in areas like art, music, social studies, science, and health, pertinent to everyday interactions. This topic area accounts for about half of the time allocated to the &#39;ethics and social impact&#39; category.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Understanding, Using, and Developing AI</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Understanding and Using AI Techniques</strong>: Involves theoretical understanding of AI processes (e.g., patterns, machine learning models) and using existing AI algorithms (e.g., training a classifier). This accounts for more than half of this category&#39;s time.</li>
		<li><strong>Understanding and Using AI Technologies</strong>: Focuses on human-facing applications like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision, and the processes behind their creation.</li>
		<li><strong>Developing AI Technologies</strong>: Deals with creating new AI applications, which is a specialized field requiring knowledge in coding, mathematics (statistics), and data science. This area generally has the lowest average allocation among the three main categories.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h3>

<p>Learning outcomes in AI curricula are defined across three domains: <strong>knowledge</strong> (cognitive demands), <strong>skills</strong> (psychomotor aspects, including analysis and revision of artifacts), and <strong>values and attitudes</strong> (guiding principles and beliefs).</p>

<p><strong>1. Knowledge Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>Students are expected to:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Understand fundamental AI concepts</strong>: Including what AI is (and is not), its basic features, definitions of &#39;weak&#39; and &#39;strong&#39; AI, and the history of its development.</li>
	<li><strong>Grasp algorithms and programming</strong>: Such as abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, the roles of algorithms in computation, their definitions, components (input, steps, output), and processes (training, testing, deployment). This also includes knowledge of programming languages and simulations.</li>
	<li><strong>Develop data literacy</strong>: Including data trends, collection and analysis principles, different types of information sources, and the characteristics of structured and unstructured data.</li>
	<li><strong>Comprehend AI techniques</strong>: Like supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), neural networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and how data is used in predictions.</li>
	<li><strong>Understand AI technologies</strong>: Such as computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), sensors, autonomous systems, and recommender systems, often comparing them to human perception.</li>
	<li><strong>Recognize applications across domains</strong>: Identify and explain AI use cases in everyday life, including how AI drives various software and physical systems, and its applications in different professions.</li>
	<li><strong>Understand ethical and societal implications</strong>: Define ethical terms like bias, fairness, and privacy in relation to AI, understand issues of access to technology, algorithmic bias, intellectual property, data security, and the principle of explainable AI. They should also reflect on AI&#39;s advantages and disadvantages, its role in everyday life and work, its environmental impacts, and issues of misinformation (e.g., deepfakes) and gendered consequences.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Skills Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>Students are expected to be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Apply computational thinking and algorithms</strong>: Recognize patterns, follow and formulate instructions, create algorithms and flowcharts, develop predictive models, and optimize computational procedures.</li>
	<li><strong>Program and develop applications</strong>: Construct simple code scripts using block-based or text-based programming (e.g., Python), control robots, and develop secure, user-friendly programs.</li>
	<li><strong>Engage in contextual problem-solving</strong>: Design, develop, and employ strategies for solving real-life problems through decomposition and pattern identification, and evaluate technological solutions.</li>
	<li><strong>Manage and analyze data</strong>: Save, sort, visualize, search for, collect, and organize data, manipulate data with spreadsheets, work with relational databases, and evaluate data quality and accuracy.</li>
	<li><strong>Utilize AI techniques and technologies</strong>: Classify objects, construct decision trees, design workflows for AI algorithms, clean data for ML, build classifiers, chatbots, and autonomous robots, and use existing AI technologies to develop new products.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaborate and innovate</strong>: Work as part of a team, use design thinking methodology for projects, create innovative solutions using AI tools, and manage technology-development projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Practice ethical engagement</strong>: Protect personal data, identify bias in algorithms, identify stakeholders, build ethical matrices, manage digital identities, undertake self-advocacy, and write guidance for ethical AI development.</li>
	<li><strong>Critically evaluate social impacts</strong>: Properly dispose of technology, identify deepfakes, recognize threats to equal opportunities, critically analyze digital content for manipulation, and contribute to public discourse.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Values and Attitudes Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>Curricula aim to develop:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Personal values</strong>: Such as <strong>interest</strong> in ICT, <strong>persistence/resilience</strong> in problem-solving, <strong>personal empowerment</strong> through project creation and advocating for rights, <strong>reflection</strong> on AI&#39;s impact on future work and society, <strong>critical thinking</strong> in evaluating information, and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> in developing innovative ideas.</li>
	<li><strong>Social values</strong>: Including <strong>collaboration/teamwork</strong> and <strong>communication</strong> through group projects and ethical guideline creation.</li>
	<li><strong>Societal values</strong>: Such as <strong>respect for others</strong> (including data privacy), <strong>personal responsibility</strong> (e.g., proper technology disposal, understanding human control over AI), <strong>integrity</strong> (mitigating bias, transparency), and <strong>tolerance</strong> for different ideas.</li>
	<li><strong>Human values</strong>: Encompassing <strong>respect for the environment/sustainable mindset</strong> (understanding technology&#39;s environmental impact, reducing computational costs) and <strong>commitment to equity</strong> (reflecting on access to AI and the inequity caused by computational costs).</li>
</ul>

<p>These comprehensive learning outcomes aim to equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and ethical understanding to navigate a world increasingly shaped by AI.</p>
