Academic Resources for XLH
--------------------------
[XLH, or x-linked hypophosphatemia](https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/x-linked-hypophosphatemia){:target="_blank"} is a rare disease where the body wastes phosphorous. This condition affects approximately 1 in 20,000 people.

I'm an academic librarian with XLH. I will be using this page to catalog significant scholarly articles and resources on XLH to enable discovery of these works. Links to open access versions of articles will be provided when possible. I will also attempt to tag sources in ways that help them be more discoverable.
